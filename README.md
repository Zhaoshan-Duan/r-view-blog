## Tasks

Fully demonstrate the following `infer` pipeline: 
* [x] `specify()`
* [x] `hypothesize()`
* [ ] `generate()`
* [ ] `calcualte()`
* [ ] `get_confidence_intervals()`
* [ ] interpretation
* [ ] How `infer` fits the modern flow better because of programming: it breaks things down, more visual (a tool to see what you're doing); 
* [ ] How `infer` embodies that "Hypothesis Testing is a workflow" 
* [ ] Explanability: what does it meawn when runing `t.test()` 
* [ ] statistics cannot be taught as Math but as programming. 
* [ ] How `infer` emphasizes data and simulations instead of theory and tests, generating p-values
